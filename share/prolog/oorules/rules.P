% Method is certain to be either a constructor or a destructor.  The reasoning here is that any
% method that is writing VFTable values into an object must be either a constructor or
% destructor, since as mentioned in the reasonVFTableWrite rule, no user code has access to the
% virtual function table address.  There was some confusion about inlined constructors for
% other objects (e.g. local stack objects or heap allocated objects), but they won't be writing
% into the current method's object, so there wouldn't have been a possibleVFTableWrite() fact
% in the first place.  Jeff Gennari and Cory Cohen are both fairly confident of this rule, but
% it's hard to prove the negative (that the compiler doesn't use the VFTable under any other
% condition).  Cory subsequently established (via the badalloc deleting destructor in
% Lite/ooex0) that deleting destructors can install the VFTable for the current object
% (possibly due to inlining?) so this conclusion does NOT say which type of destructor it might
% be.  This rule is here and named in the old style mostly so that this gigantic comment can be
% here rather than in the middle of a bunch of other rules.

% reasoning that doesn't account for this indirection.  Perhaps the other rule would be more
