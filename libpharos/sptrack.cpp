// There was a lot of very old code here, that's probably better replaced with a descriptive
// comment since the code wasn't actually compiled for a long time.  Much of the code was from
// a flawed approach where we tried to guess stack deltas based on how many pushes we found.
//
// My current understanding of the correct formulation of the constraint problem is:
//
// * Each vertex has two stack deltas (input_X and output_X).
//
// * The input stack delta for the entry point is the architecture size (for the return
//   address).
//
// * For each vertex there's a constraint that:
//   output_X = input_X + known_instruction_delta_X + unknown_call_delta_X
//
//   The known instruction delta is obtained from the semantics of the block.
//   The unknown call delta is zero if the block does not end in a call, a value loaded from
//   the API database if we known about the call, and a free variable otherwise.
//
// * For each out edge, the output stack delta on the predecessor vertex must equal the input
//   stack delta on the successor.
//
// * The output stack delta for each return instruction must equal zero (including the callee
//   cleaup amount on the RET instruction).
//
// * There may be a constraint that the starting and ending deltas are never negative (aka no
//   leaking into the neighboring stack frame).
//
// There should be a function to simply answer the question of whether there are any calls for
// which we don't know the call deltas.  If we know them all, just go straight to the usual
// "rigorous" analysis.  If we don't know one of the call deltas (or we tried the usual
// analysis and failed with a contradiction) then we should analyze each block independently to
// gather known instruction delta.  Ideally we'd use the standard ROSE stack delta analysis for
// this step.  Then we'd instantiate the solver, inject all the constraints, and solve for the
// unknown call deltas.
//
// We might need to solve repeatedly to minimize the unknown call deltas.
//
// There's also a Prolog solution to this problem in sdrules, but I supect that using Z3 is the
// better approach now.

// Some prototypes:
//
// size_t get_known_instruction_delta(block);
// size_t get_known_return_delta(block);
// void export_cfg_constraints();
// void export_vertex_constraints();
// void export_return_constraints();
