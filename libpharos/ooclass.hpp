// finalClass(ClassID, VFTable, CSize, LSize, RealDestructor, MethodList)
//
//   This result defines the existance of a class.  It is intended to be the first query to
//   Prolog, which could drive all other required queries.  The ClassID field is a unique
//   identifier for a class.
//
//   VFTable is the address of the primary virtual function table associated with this class.
//   This is the table that contains the derived class' newly declared virtual methods, and
//   typically contains the method of the class' primary parent as well.  It is typically the
//   table at offset zero in the object.  The VFTable will have the value zero if no VFTable was
//   associated with the class.  In the case of multiple inheritance, additional tables may be
//   associated with this class through the inheritance result described below.
//
//   Csize is minimum certain size of the class.  Lsize is the likely maximum size of the class.
//   The likely size is guaranteed to be greater than or equal to the certain size.  Classes are
//   explicitly permitted to have a certain size of zero, but they may not have likely sizes of
//   zero.  Classes are explicitly permitted to have certain and likely sizes that match exactly.
//   Classes are explicitly permitted to have certain and likely sizes that exceed the member
//   definitions reported as separate results, but member definitions that exceed the likely size
//   are not permitted.
//
//   The RealDestructor field is the address of the real destructor associated with the class if
//   one was identified, and zero otherwise.
//
//   The MethodList field contains all methods associated with the class regardless of their
//   confidence levels or status as constructors, destructors, etc.  This list should include only
//   those methods actually implemented on the class.  Thus all methods in the list should
//   reference the same class name in their symbols.  Listing methods in this way is partially a
//   convenience and optimization for importing class definitions into C++, since it allows the
//   association with the class to be made simply and early in the import.
//
// based on the finalClass result:
// finalClass(ClassID, VFTable, CSize, LSize, RealDestructor, MethodList)
