// Robb Matzke's BinaryCallingConvention::Convention.  His implementation was obviously
// incomplete, but he put a lot of thought into designing and documenting the class, so I
// wanted to reuse as much of his defintiion as possible.  Since 99% of the parts worth keeping
// were in the header, and there was no convenient way to extend the existing class, I just
// made a copy in our coding style, which was kind of important to me since there was a loit of
// work still to be done.  Our implementation was probably going to diverge significantly from
// his anyway, and so this seemed reasonable.

    // function, and is usually just a single symbolic variable (although there currently appears
    // to be some bug in memory read/write infrastructure that occasionally yields a
    // concat/extract expression).  When attached to a call descriptor this is the value in the
    // calling function, where it may have a wide variety of values including complex
    // expressions, and references to memory that were in fact parameters to function containing
    // the call being analyzed.

    // choice, the stack deltas should match between the caller and the called function.

    // It might be cleaner to use the deltas from the current context (calling function or called
    // function) to be consistent with the rest of these fields.  In the called function, they
    // would all be shifted by the size of a return address, and in the caller by the stacl delta

// support both this API and the lower level RegisterUsage API.  The solution appears to be to
// set convention to NULL in those cases, and report all read registers and memory as
